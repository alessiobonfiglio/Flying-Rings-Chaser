# Flying Rings Chaser

Flying Rings Chaser is a 3D endless runner video game made with WebGL, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

The WebGL API was used from scratch with particular focus on creating the rendering pipeline, the in-game physics, and the hand-made fragment and vertex shaders.

The web application can be played online [HERE](https://jolly-river-0fe96fb03.2.azurestaticapps.net/).
